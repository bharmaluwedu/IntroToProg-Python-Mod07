This week is about demonstrating how to use the functions, classes, and using the separation of concerns pattern. The following information is a breakdown on how I wrote this program step-by-step. The program is created in PyCharm 2022.2.1 with Python 3.12.2.
I have the similar program as we did in the class. The additional things are as follows:
1.	New json file name as needed.
2.	Input from user on course name
3.	Additional feature of asking GPA as a fourth element 
Since this is my second attempt, I have added all the needed items from rubric to score maximum points which includes complete script, comments and formatting, source control and GitHub page.
